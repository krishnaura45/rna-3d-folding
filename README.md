## üåü Introduction

RNA is vital to life‚Äôs most essential processes, but despite its significance, predicting its 3D structure is still difficult. Deep learning breakthroughs like AlphaFold have transformed protein structure prediction, but progress with RNA has been much slower due to limited data and evaluation methods. 

This project is part of a research challenge which was hosted on Kaggle. The objective is to develop machine learning models to predict an RNA molecule‚Äôs 3D structure from its sequence. The goal is to improve our understanding of biological processes and drive new advancements in medicine and biotechnology. In short, we have to predict five 3D structures for each RNA sequence. **Template Modeling (TM-Score)** is the custom metric which is being utilized to evaluate submissions.
